"Note: Counts were rounded to the nearest 100, and rates were rounded to the nearest 10. Detail may not sum to total due to rounding and because offenders with multiple correctional statuses were excluded from totals. Counts include estimates for nonresponding jurisdictions. See Methodology. ",,,,,,,
"a/Excludes an estimated 81,700 prisoners held in local jails; 23,500 probationers in prisons; 24,600 probationers in local jails; 21,800 parolees in local jails; 11,600 parolees in prisons; and 12,900 parolees on probation. See table 6. ",,,,,,,
